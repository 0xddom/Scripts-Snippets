# Scripts & Snippets

A collection of scripts and snippets that I made when I need them.

The great majority are made in Python or Scheme/Racket.
I also use Perl and Node.JS.

They are not usually standalone applications because I write and run them in REPLs.

## List:

* Deorganizator: This python scripts takes the files in a tree of directories and copy them to the root of another.
* PHP Shell: A very basic PHP shell, perfect for injection.
