# Scripts & Snippets

A collection of scripts and snippets that I made when I need them.

The great majority are made in Python or Scheme/Racket.
I also use Perl and Node.JS.

They are not usually standalone applications because I write and run them in REPLs.

## List:

* Deorganizator: This python script takes the files in a tree of directories and copy them to the root of another.
* PHP Shell: A very basic PHP shell, perfect for injection.
* Transpond: A bunch of scheme functions that transpond a matrix.
* Create shell test: This script creates a C program that executes a previously compiled shellcode
* Add ssh key: This script creates a new ssh key pair and pastes the public key to the clipboard. Useful for adding keys to github or bitbucket.
* bool.rb: Extension methods for True and False that implement complex boolean operators like implication, nand, etc.
